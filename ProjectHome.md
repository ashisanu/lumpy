Lumpy is a simple (but very powerful) object oriented language. Its syntax is a mixture of lua, python and java.

Lumpy gets compiled to an AST (= Abstract Syntax Tree), which is very generic. At the moment, there is only one backend for the programming language C. But you can easily write backends for Java, JavaScript and every other turing complete language. In future, there will also be a XML backend. So every developer can easily make his own backend.

The compiler itself is written in Java. So the compiler will work on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. But at the moment the development is focused on Windows.
Lumpy will also be able to compile to Open Pandora and GP2X Wiz. Maybe there will be more platforms? Possible platforms are (I'm thinking about): Webservers (PHP), iOS/Android/Bada/WebOS/MeeGo/Windows Phone 7, HTML5(JavaScript) or maybe linux bash script :D.




By the way: Sorry for my bad english, my native language is german, so all comments in the compiler code are in german.
